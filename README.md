# Welcome to My Profile!

## About Me
Welcome! My name is **Ryuzo Kijima**, and I am a sophomore at La Salle High School in Japan. I am a researcher in psychology and neuroscience, founder of a mental health care startup, and an assistant to a venture capitalist.

I began my research in psychology and neuroscience based on my own experience and that of a friend with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Later, sensing the gulf between real social issues and cutting-edge research, I started my own business in the mental health field and began working with a venture capital firm focused on deep tech.

## Goals

### Research Goals
- Elucidate the disease mechanisms of mental disorders
- Study mindfulness as a treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder
- Explore methods to prevent mental disorders of old age
- Investigate the relationship between mental health and urban design
- Reduce the number of people suffering from mental health problems by implementing research into society

### Personal Goals
- Become a professor of psychiatry
- Create a neurotech company
- Establish a venture capital firm focused on Deep Tech
- Establish a venture capital firm focused on mental health
- Produce research results that can transform the world of mental health
- Design a city focused on mental health
